# Hand-maintained configuration for libraries.
#
# All libraries with handwritten code (core, hybrid and handwritten)
# libraries have "release_blocked: true" so that releases are
# explicitly initiated
libraries:
  - id: "auth"
    release_blocked: true
  - id: "root-module"
    release_blocked: true
# The "global" files here are really only for the root module.
# The code for that module is all under civil, httpreplay and
# rpcreplay but releasing the module requires these files to
# be updated. We don't want to add source paths of "." or
# "internal" to the state file, as those would include everything
# that's *not* in the module.
