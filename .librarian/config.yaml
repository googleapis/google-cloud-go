# Hand-maintained configuration for libraries.

# The "global" files here are really only for the root module.
# The code for that module is all under civil, httpreplay and
# rpcreplay but releasing the module requires these files to
# be updated. We don't want to add a source path of "."
# to the state file, as that would include everything
# that's *not* in the module.

# All libraries with handwritten code (core, hybrid and handwritten)
# libraries have "release_blocked: true" so that releases are
# explicitly initiated
