## Contributing

Fork the repo, make changes, run the tests and open a pull request.

Before we can accept any pull requests
we have to jump through a couple of legal hurdles,
primarily a Contributor License Agreement (CLA):

- **If you are an individual writing original source code**
  and you're sure you own the intellectual property,
  then you'll need to sign an [individual CLA](https://cla.developers.google.com/about/google-individual).
- **If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work**,
  then you'll need to sign a [corporate CLA](https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/corporate).

You can sign these electronically (just scroll to the bottom).
After that, we'll be able to accept your pull requests.
