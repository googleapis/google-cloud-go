// WithReadStallTimeout provides a [ClientOption] that may be passed to [storage.NewClient].
// It enables the client to retry stalled requests when starting a download from
// Cloud Storage. If the timeout elapses with no response from the server, the request
// is automatically retried.
// The timeout is initially set to ReadStallTimeoutConfig.Min. The client tracks
// latency across all read requests from the client, and can adjust the timeout higher
// to the target percentile when latency from the server is high.
// Currently, this is supported only for downloads ([storage.NewReader] and
// [storage.NewRangeReader] calls) and only for the XML API. Other read APIs (gRPC & JSON)
// will be supported soon.

	// and Bucket, and read latency of different buckets may lie in different range.
