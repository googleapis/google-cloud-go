**This is not an officially supported Google product**

## Run example:
This runs 1000 iterations on 512kib to 2Gib files in the background, sending output to `out.log`:

`go run ./ -p {PROJECT_ID} -t 72h -max_samples 1000 -o {RESULTS_FILE_NAME}.csv &> out.log &`

\* required values

Note: while the default read/write size for HTTP clients is 4Kb 
(the default for this benchmarking), the default for GRPC is 32Kb.
If you want to capture performance using the defaults for GRPC, run the script 
separately, setting the read and write sizes to 32KB.
