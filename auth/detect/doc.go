// Package detect provides support for making OAuth2 authorized and
// authenticated HTTP requests to Google APIs. It supports the Web server flow,
// client-side credentials, service accounts, Google Compute Engine service
// accounts, Google App Engine service accounts and workload identity federation
// from non-Google cloud platforms.
//
// A brief overview of the package follows. For more information, please read
// https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2
// and
// https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/application-default-credentials.

// # Workforce Identity Federation
//
// Workforce identity federation lets you use an external identity provider (IdP) to
// authenticate and authorize a workforce—a group of users, such as employees, partners,
// and contractors—using IAM, so that the users can access Google Cloud services.
// Workforce identity federation extends Google Cloud's identity capabilities to support
// syncless, attribute-based single sign on.
//
// With workforce identity federation, your workforce can access Google Cloud resources
// using an external identity provider (IdP) that supports OpenID Connect (OIDC) or
// SAML 2.0 such as Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), Active Directory Federation
// Services (AD FS), Okta, and others.
//
// Follow the detailed instructions on how to configure Workload Identity Federation
// in various platforms:
//
//   - [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workload-identity-federation-with-other-clouds#aws)
//   - [Azure AD](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-sign-in-azure-ad)
//   - [Okta](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-sign-in-okta)
//   - [OIDC identity provider](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/configuring-workforce-identity-federation#oidc)
//   - [SAML 2.0 identity provider](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/configuring-workforce-identity-federation#saml)
//
// For workforce identity federation, the library can retrieve tokens in three ways:
// from a local file location (file-sourced credentials), from a server
// (URL-sourced credentials), or from a local executable (executable-sourced
// credentials).
// For file-sourced credentials, a background process needs to be continuously
// refreshing the file location with a new OIDC/SAML token prior to expiration.
// For tokens with one hour lifetimes, the token needs to be updated in the file
// every hour. The token can be stored directly as plain text or in JSON format.
// For URL-sourced credentials, a local server needs to host a GET endpoint to
// return the OIDC/SAML token. The response can be in plain text or JSON.
// Additional required request headers can also be specified.
// For executable-sourced credentials, an application needs to be available to
// output the OIDC/SAML token and other information in a JSON format.
// For more information on how these work (and how to implement
// executable-sourced credentials), please check out:
// https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-obtaining-short-lived-credentials#generate_a_configuration_file_for_non-interactive_sign-in
//
// Note that this library does not perform any validation on the token_url,
// token_info_url, or service_account_impersonation_url fields of the credential
// configuration. It is not recommended to use a credential configuration that
// you did not generate with the gcloud CLI unless you verify that the URL
// fields point to a googleapis.com domain.
//
// # Credentials
//
// The [Credentials] type represents Google credentials, including Application
// Default Credentials.
//
// Use [DefaultCredentials] to obtain Application Default Credentials.
//
// Application Default Credentials support workload identity federation to
// access Google Cloud resources from non-Google Cloud platforms including Amazon
// Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure or any identity provider that supports
// OpenID Connect (OIDC). Workload identity federation is recommended for
// non-Google Cloud environments as it avoids the need to download, manage, and
// store service account private keys locally.
