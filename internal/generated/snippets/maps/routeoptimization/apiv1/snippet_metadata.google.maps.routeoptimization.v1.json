The inputs for optimization\n(`OptimizeToursRequest` messages) and outputs (`OptimizeToursResponse`\nmessages) are read from and written to Cloud Storage in user-specified\nformat. Like the `OptimizeTours` method, each `OptimizeToursRequest`\ncontains a `ShipmentModel` and returns an `OptimizeToursResponse`\ncontaining `ShipmentRoute` fields, which are a set of routes to be\nperformed by vehicles minimizing the overall cost.\n\nThe user can poll `operations.get` to check the status of the LRO: \n\nIf the LRO `done` field is false, then at least one request is still\nbeing processed. Other requests may have completed successfully and their\nresults are available in Cloud Storage.\n\nIf the LRO's `done` field is true, then all requests have been processed.\nAny successfully processed requests will have their results available in\nCloud Storage. Any requests that failed will not have their results\navailable in Cloud Storage. If the LRO's `error` field is set, then it\ncontains the error from one of the failed requests.",
