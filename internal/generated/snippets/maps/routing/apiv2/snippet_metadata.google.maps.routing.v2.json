You can provide the response field mask by using the URL\nparameter $fields or fields, or by using the HTTP/gRPC header\nX-Goog-FieldMask (see the available URL parameters and\nheaders (at https: //cloud.google.com/apis/docs/system-parameters). The value\nis a comma separated list of field paths. See this detailed documentation\nabout how to construct the field\npaths (at https: //github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/master/src/google/protobuf/field_mask.proto).\n\nFor example, in this method: \n\n\tField mask of all available fields (for manual inspection): \n\tX-Goog-FieldMask: *\n\n\tField mask of route durations, distances, element status, condition, and\n\telement indices (an example production setup): \n\tX-Goog-FieldMask: originIndex,destinationIndex,status,condition,distanceMeters,duration\n\nIt is critical that you include status in your field mask as otherwise\nall messages will appear to be OK. Google discourages the use of the\nwildcard (*) response field mask, because: \n\n\tSelecting only the fields that you need helps our server save computation\n\tcycles, allowing us to return the result to you with a lower latency.\n\n\tSelecting only the fields that you need in your production job ensures\n\tstable latency performance. We might add more response fields in the\n\tfuture, and those new fields might require extra computation time. If you\n\tselect all fields, or if you select all fields at the top level, then you\n\tmight experience performance degradation because any new field we add will\n\tbe automatically included in the response.\n\n\tSelecting only the fields that you need results in a smaller response\n\tsize, and thus higher network throughput.",
