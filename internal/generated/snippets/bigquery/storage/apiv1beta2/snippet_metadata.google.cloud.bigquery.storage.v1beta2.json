      "description": "CreateReadSession creates a new read session. A read session divides the contents of a\nBigQuery table into one or more streams, which can then be used to read\ndata from the table. The read session also specifies properties of the\ndata to be read, such as a list of columns or a push-down filter describing\nthe rows to be returned.\n\nA particular row can be read by at most one stream. When the caller has\nreached the end of each stream in the session, then all the data in the\ntable has been read.\n\nData is assigned to each stream such that roughly the same number of\nrows can be read from each stream. Because the server-side unit for\nassigning data is collections of rows, the API does not guarantee that\neach stream will return the same number or rows. Additionally, the\nlimits are enforced based on the number of pre-filtered rows, so some\nfilters can lead to lopsided assignments.\n\nRead sessions automatically expire 6 hours after they are created and do\nnot require manual clean-up by the caller.",
