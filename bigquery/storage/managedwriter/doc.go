// Package managedwriter will be a thick client around the storage API's BigQueryWriteClient.
//
// It is EXPERIMENTAL and subject to change or removal without notice.  This library is in a pre-alpha
// state, and breaking changes are frequent.
//
// Currently, the BigQueryWriteClient this library targets is exposed in the storage v1beta2 endpoint, and is
// a successor to the streaming interface.  API method tabledata.insertAll is the primary backend method, and
// the Inserter abstraction is the equivalent to this in the cloud.google.com/go/bigquery package.
